  - question: "Explain what a Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) pipeline is in OpenShift AI."
    answer: |
      A KFP pipeline (rawad) is a directed acyclic graph of containerized steps executed by the Data Science Pipelines
      service. You define components and how outputs feed into downstream steps, then run it as an experiment/run.
  - question: "How do I quickly verify that my Data Science Pipelines server is running?"
    answer: |
      Confirm the pipeline server shows as Running in the OpenShift AI UI, then run a small two-step pipeline and
      verify both steps succeed and logs show expected output.
  - question: "What is Kueue used for with GPU workloads?"
    answer: |
      Kueue provides queueing and admission control for workloads requesting scarce resources like GPUs. It decides
      when a workload is admitted based on quotas, flavors, and priority before Kubernetes schedules pods.
